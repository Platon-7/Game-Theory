# Game Theory

This course is from the final semester of my studies. It included two projects, which accounted for a total of 2.5 points out of 10, with 0.5 points considered as a bonus. Additionally, there was an optional presentation on a paper of our choice within the domain of Game Theory.

It covers the following topics:

## Probability:

- A priori, a posteriori, and subjective probabilities.

## Decision Making:

- Formulation of decision problems using Decision trees.
- Decision selection criteria.

## Bayesian Decision Making:

- Bayes' theorem and Bayes' decision rules.
- Determination of utility functions.

## Game Theory:

- Introduction to game theory.
- Game trees, extensive and normal form.
- Two-player games, zero and nonzero sum.

## Applications:

- Application of concepts to auctions.
- Other applications in economics, computer science, and business.

Overall, the course provides a comprehensive understanding of probability, decision-making using decision trees, Bayesian decision rules, and game theory. It explores applications in various fields, including economics, computer science, and business.
